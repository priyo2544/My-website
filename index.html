            My name is Authan Farsi, I am a 22-year-old tech enthusiast and cybersecurity expert. Bangladesh is my homeland, and I am proud to have been born in a country where technology and creativity have immense potential. Currently, I am working at Cyber ​​The Crime Bench LulzSec, where I play a key role in cybersecurity and cybercrime prevention.

My love for technology has been with me since childhood. I have always wanted to do something that would be beneficial not only for myself, but also for society. Cybercrime is a major threat in today's world, and I am proud to be associated with an organization that works to keep the digital world safe.

I constantly try to improve myself in the world of technology. The main goal of my work is to strengthen cybersecurity, prevent hacking, and keep the digital world safe. I believe that a true technologist is not only known for his skills, but also is able to bring positive change to society.

My honesty, hard work, and unwavering love for technology inspire me to do better every day. In the future, I would like to work on a larger scale, so that I can build a stronger resistance against cybercrime.

I am proud to be a part of Cyber ​​The Crime Bench LulzSec and working to ensure security in the cyber world. My journey for the development of technology and security will continue, and I believe that my work will one day bring positive changes in society.
